Hello all, 
Backlog Status 
[Done] [OpenAI POC - 94064] Implement retries on match-winner endpoint. 
[Done] [OpenAI POC - 94068] Fix lineup prompt. 
More Details    
Today, we continued testing the application and identified an issue with the API that occurs approximately once every 10 requests made to OpenAI. To mitigate this, we implemented a try-catch mechanism in the API, ensuring up to three retry attempts to obtain a valid response. 
Upon further investigation, we discovered that the issue arises when the AI occasionally returns additional information beyond the expected JSON format. To address this, we refined the input prompts to enforce a stricter response structure, ensuring the output is limited to the expected JSON. This adjustment was applied to both the prompt for calculating match odds and the prompt for selecting the team's lineup. 
These improvements significantly enhance the API's robustness, reducing response variability and aligning it more closely with the application's requirements. 
Thanks,â€¯
