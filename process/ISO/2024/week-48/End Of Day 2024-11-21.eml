Hello all, 
Backlog Status 
[Done] [OpenAI POC - 94064] Implement retries on match-winner endpoint. 
[Done] [OpenAI POC - 94068] Fix lineup prompt. 
[In Progress] Research on new project idea 
More Details    
Today, we began researching and planning for a new project aimed at developing a Teams plugin to streamline the automation of ISO generation. The plugin's core functionality will be to generate the ISO report from the SOD and EOD emails sent during the week. It includes filtering, downloading and structuring the emails according to ISO standards and finally pushing to the repository associated with the project with the generated ISO. 
Once generated, these reports will be automatically distributed to the team via email and Teams chat. This solution aims to enhance operational efficiency by minimizing manual effort, ensuring consistent documentation, and improving accessibility for the entire team. 
Finally, we created a backlog on Azure Boards with possible User Stories and tasks to start diagramming the development and discussing next Monday. 
Thanks,â€¯
