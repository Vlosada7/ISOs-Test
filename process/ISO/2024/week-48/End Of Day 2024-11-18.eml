Hello all, 
Backlog Status 
[Done] [OpenAIPOC - 93960] Implement input to betting margin 
More Details    
Today, we implemented a new input feature to allow users to dynamically set the betting margin for each match, replacing the previously hardcoded value. 
This enhancement provides greater flexibility, enabling the system to adjust predictions based on the specific characteristics of different matches. By allowing users to fine-tune the margin, we can achieve more accurate results that better align with real-world betting conditions. 
Finally, we begin with the construction of the system architecture diagram. First detailing the different Azure resources within each subnet, the automation account and the description of the aks. 
Thanks,â€¯
