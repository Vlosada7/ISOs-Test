Hello all, 
Backlog Status 
[Done] Project Power Point presentation 
More Details    
Today, we delivered a comprehensive PowerPoint presentation showcasing our project. The presentation covered critical aspects such as the project goals, user flow and inputs, system outputs, system architecture, DevOps and infrastructure setup, an architecture diagram, metrics, and a comparison with BWIN. 
Additionally, we included screenshots of the UI and results, providing a visual representation of the user experience and the system's predictive capabilities. This presentation highlighted the robustness of our solution, from its technical foundation to its practical applications, emphasizing its alignment with real-world betting scenarios and benchmarks. 
Furthermore, we completed the Excel with the exclusive comparison of our system with BWIN by sending the specific betting margin for each match. The result was odds much closer to the real results, with a maximum difference average of less than 5% in all cases, which is quite tight. Finally, we reflected this table in the presentation slides. 
Thanks,â€¯
