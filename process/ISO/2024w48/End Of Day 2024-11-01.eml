More Details    
Today, we added functionality in the UI to allow users to add teams and competitions they would like to query, introducing a new button on the main page that redirects to a dedicated insertion page. This new feature is fully integrated with the API, streamlining the process for users to submit and manage their entries directly from the interface.

Additionally, we updated the API controllers to prevent duplicate entries in the database, whether through direct endpoint submissions or from our static JSON files containing predefined records. This ensures data integrity by avoiding redundant records and enhances the overall efficiency of our data management approach.
